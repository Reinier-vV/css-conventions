If you have something you want to add or remove, please open a new pull request. Since these guides are used by different organisations such as [Aan Zee](http://www.aanzee.nl/), new pull requests will be discussed with several people before your pull request can be accepted. We are probably in another timezone than you, so all pull requests will be left open for at least a week.
